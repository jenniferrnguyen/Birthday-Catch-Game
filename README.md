# Birthday-Catch-Game

## Project Introduction 
- This was one of my first personal projects. 
- I created this game in my first term of undergrad as a birthday surprise for my friend.
- This game used a systematic test-driven methodology 
- Through completing this project I was able to apply and solidify concepts I learned my first CS course
- I was able to explore both basic programming for both front end and back end development 

## Game Description 
- Birthday-Catch-Game is a simple desktop application
- The objective of the game is to catch all the balls before they touch the bottom wall of the screen 
- The birthday twist is that the "ball" and "paddle" are an images of the birthday girl :)
- The background colour is also their favourite colour
