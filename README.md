# Birthday-Catch-Game

## Project Introduction 
- This was one of my first personal projects. 
- I created this game in my first term of undergrad as a birthday surprise for my friend.
- This game used a systematic test-driven methodology. 
- Through completing this project I was able to apply and solidify concepts I learned my first CS course.
- I was able to explore both basic programming for both front end and back end development.

## Game Description 
- Birthday-Catch-Game is a simple desktop application.
- The objective of the game is to catch all the balls. Balls are caught and disappear if they touch the middle of the game paddle. 
- The game paddle can be toggled right and left using the users keyboard arrow keys. 
- Clicking on the screen creates a new ball at that spot with a random velosity.
- Balls bounce off the edges of the screen and maintain a constant velosity throughout its lifetime. 
- The birthday twist is that the "ball" and "paddle" are an images of the birthday girl :)
- The background colour is also their favourite colour.

## What The Game Looks Like:

## If I Had More Time || Improvements/Advancements I Would Make:
- I would add a scorbouard to keep track of the number of balls that were caught. 
- Currently the Game runs forever until the user exits the application window. A functionality that would be interesting to add is a time limit so that there is an atomic end to each game. Additionally, this would also allow for other functionalites such as having a leaderboard or highscore for the number of balls caught during the game duration. 
- Instead of having one ball, I this it would be more engaging to have a pool of differnt ball types. Then whenever a new ball is created by the user clicking the screen, one of the balls is randomly drawn from theball pool (i.e., similar to how a new ball gets a random velosity).
- I would explore the option of allowing the user to pick their paddle type from a displayed list.
